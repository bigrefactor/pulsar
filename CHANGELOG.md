## [Unreleased]

### Changed - Twm Adoption

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `bigrefactor/tailwind_merge` runtime dependency with [`twm`](https://hex.pm/packages/twm) (`~> 0.1`). Apps must update `mix.exs` and re-run `mix deps.get`. Generated components now `import Twm, only: [merge: 1]` instead of `TailwindMerge`. The install task adds `{Twm.Cache, []}` to the host app's supervision tree for LRU class-merge caching by default.
- **Tailwind v4 utility coverage**: Twm is a port of `tailwind-merge` JS v3.3.0, with native conflict-resolution for v4 utilities (`text-shadow-*`, `inset-shadow-*`, `field-sizing-*`, `mask-*`, etc.) that the previous merger did not know about.

### Changed - Self-Contained Component Library

- **BREAKING**: Complete self-contained component library implementation 
- **Single Dependency**: Only requires Twm for intelligent class merging
- **Self-Contained Components**: All 11 core components now include inlined accessibility and behavior
- **Production Ready**: Complete component coverage for Phoenix applications
- **Clean Architecture**: Zero compilation warnings, full test coverage maintained

### Added - Complete Component Library

- **Badge**: Flexible labels with variants and sizes (partial implementation)
- **Button**: Interactive buttons with loading states and colocated JavaScript hooks  
- **Checkbox**: Form checkboxes with card variants and Phoenix integration
- **Icon**: Centralized icon component with Heroicons support (partial implementation)
- **Input**: Text inputs with decorator system and validation support
- **Label**: Semantic labels with error states and accessibility
- **Link**: Navigation links with XSS protection and Phoenix routing
- **RadioGroup**: Radio button groups with ARIA semantics and card variants
- **Select**: Dropdown selects with option generation and form integration
- **Switch**: Toggle switches with Phoenix form support  
- **Textarea**: Multi-line text inputs with character counting

### Security & Accessibility

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All components include proper ARIA attributes
- **XSS Protection**: Built-in input sanitization and output escaping
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper semantic markup and state announcements
